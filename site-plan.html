        <p>
          Allow me to introduce you to my God. First and foremost, meet his son. Bring your chains. He'll break them if you want him to. After that, he'll lead us to his Father. The Holy Ghost you have already received or which you may choose to receive will act as a kind of omnipresent mediator so Christ can connect us all on our individual and group lines. Haven't received the Holy Ghost yet? No worries. The Holy Ghost is a gift from God available to anyone willing to be administered to by the bearers of his Holy Priesthood. They are available to be contacted at https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/lp/meet-with-missionaries/short?cid=C15856363587G138717384858A602705674974&adlang=eng&source=google&network=g&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA3sq6BhD2ARIsAJ8MRwWKZBxyKiDoKaySou5XAL5nuex62_1lmsLrXBw5FffueaywmB8RY-0aAuv7EALw_wcB . These ministers also have plenty of introductory instructions for those who desire to walk with Christ in a safe, effective, and loving way. They will introduce you to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and instruct you in God's eternal love for you, The Restoration of His son's church, God's plan of Salvation, The Gospel of Jesus Christ, and God's continuing laws for peace in this life and eternal life in life to come.
